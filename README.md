# Simplified Scala 

## Step 1 
   
* Utility coolness 
    * Cool Strings 
    * Time.it
    * PrettyPrint file sizing 
    * FindAllFiles
* Find our data file in the directory tree. 
    * There is a Shakespeare.txt file with all of his works
* Read the data file in 
    * Read and label all of the lines with line numbers attached

## Step 2 (a and b) 

* Write data to a file the hard way
* AutoCloseable introduced in Java 7 - "try with resources"
* FileSaver with AutoCloseable - all at once writing 
* StreamSaver with AutoCloseable - write on demand 

## Step 3 

* Discuss ORM layers and common use cases
* Discuss AutoCloseable resources with JDBC connections
* Docker-compose config and standup 
* Connect to a database( MySQL )
* Create a table to write data into

## Step 4 

* Write data into the database with batching
* Read a sonnet back out of the database in domain objects
* Look at de-serialization simplicity and performance
